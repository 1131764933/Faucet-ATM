# 1. Overview
This project is an open-source universal Faucet-ATM aggregator for Web3, aimed at helping developers learn Web3 development better, initiated by OpenBuild.

We welcome developers to contribute to this project, whether it's coding, testing, or documentation writing. 👏

# 2. Why Contribute
We believe that developers can not only improve their technical skills through contributing to open source but also build better personal influence within the community. Therefore, we encourage developers to participate in open-source projects. **Don't worry about your abilities; you can start from the simplest tasks. Even if it's not code, the most important thing is to take the first step.** We recommend reading this article: [Why Contribute to an Open Source
Community?](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/blog/cn/material/open_source_community/)

Besides the aforementioned open-source "gifts," we also provide various types of material incentives to show our sincere appreciation for everyone's contributions!

**However, please note that we don't want people to participate solely for monetary gains**; rather, we want them to recognize the value of participating in open source and the community for their long-term growth and development.

## 2.1 Bounty Incentives
We will release some development tasks as [Task Issues](https://github.com/Faucet-ATM/Faucet-ATM/issues), tagged with the Task label 🏷️. Interested individuals can assess the development time (in hours) in the corresponding issue. We will select the most suitable developer from there and assign the task to them. **Upon completion of the task and its acceptance via PR, we will reward $5/hour as compensation💰.**

Each Task has 3 statuses:

- recruiting: Indicates the task has not started, and developers are evaluating it.
- building: Indicates the task is already in progress.
- completed: Indicates the task has been completed.

> Rewards will be distributed within 3 days after the PR is completed, sent via USDT.
>
> The reward amount may change in the future, but it will not affect ongoing or completed tasks.

## 2.2 OpenBuild SBT Incentives

For developers who actively contribute (>=40 hours), we will issue OpenBuild SBT. Holding OpenBuild offers the following benefits:

- OpenBuild customized peripherals
- OpenBuild platform bounty/recruitment green channel
- Boosting personal technical influence
- Developer growth package (high-value tutorials, technical books, credits/licenses for various development platforms, etc.)
- Potential partner airdrops
- Others
